- Paul shared a strong local-AI-services case study/playbook to remember:
  - Build list of ~30 local businesses in 15-mile radius.
  - Ask one discovery question: "What’s the most annoying part of your day?"
  - Don’t pitch AI; offer fast fix timeline ("What if that was fixed by Monday?").
  - Build live workflow in minutes while client watches.
  - Claimed Saturday closes:
    - Pool company: $2,500 setup + $500/mo
    - PT clinic: $3,800
    - Cleaning company: $2,200 + $400/mo
    - Dog groomer: $450 one-time
    - Pest control: $1,800 + $300/mo
  - Totals cited: $10,750 upfront + $1,200/mo from 5 closes; 7 follow-ups scheduled.
  - Framework components mentioned:
    - 1-question discovery script
    - 6 copy/paste workflow prompts
    - complexity-based pricing guide
    - MCP setup for self-healing workflows
- Actionable strategic lesson for Paul: local pain-point-first offers + live demo closing can outperform pitch decks.
