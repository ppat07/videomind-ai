# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Paul Patlur
- **What to call them:** Paul
- **Pronouns:** he/him
- **Timezone:** America/Chicago (CST) — Milwaukee, Wisconsin
- **Notes:** First session 2026-02-17.

## Who Paul Is

Paul is a connector, encourager, and entertainer at heart. He spent 10 years in full-time ministry with Youth With A Mission (YWAM) — teaching the Bible, discipling young people, and spreading the gospel. That season shaped who he is: someone who genuinely loves people and wants to brighten their day.

He's not a developer or a tech guy by trade. He's a people person with a creative streak and a business mind.

## Work

- **Day job:** Sales team at a marketing company. Sets appointments for his boss (the closer). Outbound dials prospects in home services — HVAC, plumbers, electricians.
- **Not his passion** but he's using it to sharpen his sales skills.
- **Tools:** Gmail, HubSpot, SalesMessage, LocalFalcon.

## Side Projects & Goals

- **Content creation:** Wants to do this full time. Loves entertaining, cracking jokes, silly skits, building community. Goes live on OBS → YouTube.
  - YouTube: @paulp7974
  - X (Twitter): @paulpatlur
- **Ad sales for Andrew Thomas Visuals:** Friend with 119k YouTube subs in the hunting niche. Paul is selling advertising slots to companies who want to reach that audience.
- **Lead generation:** Finding cheaper/better alternatives to Facebook ads for his company's clients.
- **Crypto:** Big XRP fan. Does some trading but has lost money recently. Invested but didn't take profits when the market was up — learning from that.

## Life

- Lives in Milwaukee, WI in a duplex with his girlfriend and two kids, third on the way.
- **About to propose next month!** 💍
- Wants to buy a house — needs to pay off $30-40K in debt first (crypto losses from not taking profits).
- Goal: get into their own space for the growing family.
- Wants to move closer to her in-laws near Bristol, WI — they'll be going through challenges and Paul wants them near the grandkids.

## Personality & Working Style

- **Shiny object syndrome** — jumps between interests (SEO → crypto → sales training → crypto). Needs help staying in one lane.
- Combination of direct and encouraging. Likes to be challenged but in a friendly way.
- Not the "smartest guy in the room" (his words, not mine — I disagree) but street smart, people smart, and willing to grind.
- Motivated by connection, story, laughter, and lifting others up.

## Platforms & Media

- X for social media and news
- YouTube for news, podcasts, how-tos, and his own content
- Facebook Marketplace for buying things
- Google Search for research
- OBS for streaming/content creation

## The Bigger Vision

Get his own life dialed in — income, content, health, faith, family — then use that platform to teach, encourage, and disciple other men who are stuck. Help them get out of their spot and into something better. The missionary heart never left.
