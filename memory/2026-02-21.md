- Afternoon mission sprint: shipped AI Training Directory CSV export for filtered results.
- Added new API endpoint `GET /api/directory/export/csv` with support for existing filters (`q`, `category`, `difficulty`, `creator`, `min_signal`, `sort_by`, `limit`).
- Added UI button in directory page to export current filtered dataset directly to CSV.
- Refactored frontend filter param collection to reuse query logic between listing and export.
- Quick validation: `python3 -m py_compile src/api/directory.py` passed.
